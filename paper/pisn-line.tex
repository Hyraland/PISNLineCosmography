  \fixme{This has now changed.}
  Gravitational interactions are scale-free.  Because of this freedom, there is
  a perfect degeneracy between the mass scale and redshift of a gravitational
  wave source; some non-gravitational process is necessary to provide redshift
  information. \Ac{GW} observations do provide direct information about the
  luminosity distance of a \ac{GW} source.  Here we suggest that the \ac{PISN}
  process, thought to impose a sharp upper-limit on the source-frame mass of
  \ac{BH} stellar remnants, provides an ``absorption line'' that permits a
  statistical measurement of the redshift-luminosity-distance relation using a
  population of \ac{BBH} inspirals.  Assuming that the intrinsic scatter in the
  mass upper-limit of the \ac{BH} mass distribution imposed by the \ac{PISN}
  process is $\lesssim 1\,\MSun$, we simulate one and five years of Advanced
  LIGO \ac{BBH} detections at its design sensitivity with realistic
  uncertainties in mass and distance measurements and show that analysis of
  these populations permits determination of the Hubble constant to $\pm
  \oneYearUncert$ after one and $\pm \fiveYearUncert$ after five years of
  observation.  This method will provide the best constraints on the Hubble
  constant from \ac{GW} observations of merging \ac{BBH} systems (observations
  of merging binary neutron stars and associated electromagnetic counterparts
  will provide better constraints overall). Observations by future
  ``third-generation'' \ac{GW} detectors, which can see \ac{BBH} mergers
  throughout the universe, using this method would permit sub-percent
  cosmographical measurements within one month of observation.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\fixme{Boring details about mass ratio distribution, redshift evolution, etc,
etc.}  We draw our events from a model similar to \citet{Fishbach2018}.  In our
model, \ac{BBH} mergers occur with a rate density that is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:model}
  \diff{N}{m_1 \dd m_2 \dd V \dd t} =
  \begin{cases}
    R_0 \frac{\left(1 - \alpha\right) m_1^{-\alpha}}{\MMax^{1-\alpha} - \MMin^{1-\alpha}} \frac{\left(1 + \beta\right) m_2^\beta}{m_1^{1+\beta} - \MMin^{1+\beta}} \left( 1 + z \right)^{\gamma} & \MMin \leq m_2 < m_1 \leq \MMax \\
    0 & \textnormal{otherwise}
  \end{cases},
\end{equation}
%
where all quantities are referred to the source frame, $V$ is the comoving
volume (see \citet{Hogg1999} for a review of distance measures in cosmology),
the parameter $R_0$ is the volumetric merger rate at $z = 0$, $\MMin$ and
$\MMax$ are parameters giving the minimum and maximum black hole (source frame)
mass, the parameter $\alpha$ is the power-law slope of the mass function for the
more massive \ac{BH} in a \ac{BBH} merger, the parameter $\beta$ is the
power-law slope of the distribution of the smaller mass conditioned on the value
of $m_1$, and the parameter $\gamma$ controls the redshift evolution of the
merger rate.  We ignore the spins of the merging \acp{BH}; our catalogs contain
only non-spinning \acp{BH}.  Our catalogs are generated with the physically
reasonable parameters $R_0 = \RZeroTrue{}$ \citep{O1-BBH}, $\alpha =
\alphaTrue{}$ \citep{Fishbach2017}, $\gamma = \gammaTrue{}$
\citep{Fishbach2018}, $\MMin = \MSourceMin{}$
\citep{Ozel2010,Farr2011,Kreidberg2012}, and $\MMax = \MSourceMax{}$
\citep{Fishbach2017}.  We use cosmological parameters from Table 4,
``TT,TE,EE+lowP+lensing+ext'' of \citet{Planck2016}, as implemented in the
\texttt{Planck15} object of the \texttt{astropy.cosmology} module from
\citet{Astropy2018}.

\Ac{GW} detectors are directly sensitive to the mass and redshift combination
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Mdet-definition}
  \mdet \equiv \msource \left( 1 + z \right),
\end{equation}
%
where $\mdet$ is a mass parameter as measured in the detector frame, $\msource$
is the corresponding mass in the source frame, and $z$ is the redshift of the
source.  The amplitude of a gravitational wave measured at the detector depends
only on $\monedet$; $\mtwodet$; the luminosity distance, $d_L$, to the source;
and angular factors describing the orientation of the source's orbit and
position on the sky relative to the \ac{GW} antenna. Comparing parameterised
\ac{GW} waveforms
\citep[e.g.][]{Taracchini2014,Bohe2017,Smith2016,Kahn2016,Chatziioannou2017} to
the data observed by \ac{GW} detectors it is possible to produce a posterior
distribution over \ac{BBH} parameters that describes our uncertainty about the
source properties \citep{Veitch2015,GW150914-PE}; in particular, one can obtain
a marginalized three-dimensional distribution describing our knowledge of
$\monedet$, $\mtwodet$, and $d_L$, ignoring all other parameters (here we follow
the standard convention of denoting the mass of the more massive component of
the binary by $m_1$ and of the less massive component by $m_2$).  Rather than
simulate this process for the mergers in our catalog, we here approximate the
posterior that would be obtained from a proper analysis using a method similar
to \citet{Fishbach2018}, but tuned to produce uncertainties in these two
parameters that are comparable to GW170814 \citep{GW170814} at comparable
signal-to-noise ratios.  Unlike \citet{Fishbach2018}, we use \ac{GW} amplitudes
as implemented in the ``IMRPhenomPv2'' waveform \citep{Kahn2016} that
incorporate the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of the source; a source is
considered detected if its (noisily-measured) amplitude exceeds a
signal-to-noise threshold of 8 in a hypothetical detector with the .

We generate catalogs of events that correspond to all detected \ac{BBH} events
from one year and five years of three-detector observing time at design
sensitivity \citep{AdvancedLIGO,AdvancedVIRGO}.  The first year's observations
of the five-year catalog are identical to the one-year catalog. The catalogs
contain \None{} and \Nfive{} events.  Figure \ref{fig:true-det-masses-dLs} shows
the true (detector frame) masses and luminosity distances for the detected
events; the events range from $\sim 5 \, \MSun$ to $80 \, \MSun$ in mass
(detector frame) and reach to $d_L \sim 6 \, \Gpc$.  Our approximation to the
posterior produces the set of inferred masses and distances shown in Figure
\ref{fig:obs-det-masses-dLs}.

  luminosity distances for the one year (dark) and five year (light) catalogs
  described in Section \ref{sec:method}.  The effect of redshifting on the mass
  can clearly be seen; the maximum source-frame mass is $\MSourceMax$.  The
  solid black line gives the maximum detector-frame mass as a function of
  luminosity distance for the cosmology used to generate the catalog
  \citep{Planck2016}; the dashed lines give the same relation but for a 10\%
  change in $H_0$.}

  line gives the maximum detector-frame mass as a function of luminosity
  distance for the cosmology used to generate the catalog.}
