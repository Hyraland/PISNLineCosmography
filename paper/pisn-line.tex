  Joint measurements of distance and redshift can be used to constrain the
  expansion history of the universe and the associated cosmological parameters
  \citationhere{}. Merging \ac{BBH} systems are standard sirens
  \citep{Schutz1986,Holz2005}---their gravitational waveform provides direct
  information about the luminosity distance to the source.  Because gravity is
  scale-free, there is a perfect degeneracy between the source mass and redshift
  in the waveform; some non-gravitational information is necessary to break the
  degenracy and determine the redshift of the source
  \citep{Schutz1986,Chernoff1993,Finn1996,Wang1997,Holz2005,Dalal2006,Taylor2012,Messenger2012,GW170817-H0}.
  Here we suggest that the \ac{PISN}
  \citep{Heger2002,Belczynski2016,Woosley2017,Spera2017} process, thought to be
  the source of the observed upper-limit on the \ac{BH} mass in merging \ac{BBH}
  systems at $\sim \MSourceMax{}$ \citep{O1O2Population}, provides such
  information and permits a measurement of the redshift-luminosity-distance
  relation using a population of \ac{BBH} inspirals.  With realistic assumptions
  about the merger rate \citep{GWTC-1}, a mass distribution incorporating a
  sharp \ac{PISN} cutoff \citep{O1O2Population}, and measurement uncertainty
  \citep{Vitale2017} for \ac{BBH} inspirals in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo
  detectors at design sensitivity \citationhere{}, we simulate five years of
  \ac{BBH} detections. We show that after one year of operation at design
  sensitivity (\fixme{put date here}) the \ac{BBH} population can constrain
  $H(z)$ to $\SigmaHPvtOneYear$ at a pivot redshift $z \simeq \zpivot$.  After
  five years (\fixme{date}) the constraint improves to $\SigmaHPvtFiveYear$.
  This measurement relies only on general relativity and the presence of a
  cutoff mass scale that is approximately fixed or calibrated across cosmic time
  ($\Delta \MMax \lesssim 1 \, M_\odot$); it is independent of any distance
  ladder or cosmological model. When combined with a percent-level local
  measurement of the Hubble constant \citep{Chen2017} and a sub-percent
  constraint on the physical matter density from CMB measurements
  \citep{Planck2016} in a $w\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological model, the dark energy
  equation of state parameter is determined with $\SigmaWDEFiveYear$
  uncertainty. Observations by future ``third-generation'' \ac{GW} detectors
  \citationhere{}, which can see \ac{BBH} mergers throughout the universe, would
  permit sub-percent cosmographical measurements to $z \gtrsim 4$ within one
  month of observation.

\section*{ }

The \ac{GWTC1} contains ten binary black hole merger events observed during
Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO's first and second observing runs
\citep{GWTC-1}. Modeling of this population suggests a precipitous drop in the
merger rate for primary black hole masses larger than $\sim \MSourceMax{}$
\citep{Fishbach2017,GWTC-1}.  A possible explanation for this drop is the
\ac{PISN} process \citationhere{}. This process occurs in the cores of massive
stars (helium core masses $30$--$133 \, \MSun$ \citep{Woosley2017}) when the
core temperature becomes sufficiently high to permit the production of
electron-positron pairs; pair production softens the equation of state of the
core, leading to a collapse which is halted by nuclear burning
\citep{Heger2002}.  The energy produced can either unbind the star, leaving no
\ac{BH} remnant, or drive a mass-loss pulse that reduces the mass of the star
until the \ac{PISN} is halted, leading to remnant masses $\sim \MSourceMax{}$.
Modeling suggests that the upper limit on the remnant mass may vary by less than
\fixme{XX} with redshift for $0 \leq z \lesssim 2$ \citep{Belczynski2016}.

Compact object mergers that emit gravitational waves have a universal
characteristic peak luminosity $c^5/G \simeq 3.6 \times 10^{59} \, \mathrm{erg}
\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ that enables direct measurements of the luminosity distance
to these sources \citep{Schutz1986}.  They are standard sirens \citep{Holz2005}.
However, the source-frame mass of the merging objects is degenerate with the
redshift; the waveform depends only on the redshifted mass in the detector
frame, $m_\mathrm{det} = m_\mathrm{source} (1 + z)$.  General relativity
predicts the gravitational waveforms of stellar-mass \ac{BBH} mergers.  Using
parameterized models of these waveforms
\citep{Taracchini2014,Kahn2016,Bohe2017,Chatziioannou2017}, it will be possible
to measure the detector-frame masses with $\sim 20\%$ uncertainty and luminosity
distances \citep{Hogg1999} with $\sim 50\%$ uncertainty for a source near the
detection threshold in Advanced LIGO and Anvanced Virgo at design sensitivity
\citep{Vitale2017} \citationhere{}.  The uncertainty in these parameters scales
inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio of a source \citep{Vitale2017}.

If the \ac{BBH} merger rate follows the star formation rate
\citep{Fishbach2018,O1O2Population}, the primary mass distribution follows a
declining power law $m_1^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \simeq 0.75$ for $m_1 \lesssim
\MSourceMax{}$, the mass ratio distribution is flat, and the three-detector duty
cycle is $\sim 50\%$ then Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo should detect $\sim
1000$ \ac{BBH} mergers per year at design sensitivity over a range of redshifts
$0 \leq z \lesssim 1.5$.  The typical detected merger will have a redshift $z
\sim 0.75$.  If we assume that $\sim 1/2$ these detections are informative about
the redshifted upper limit on the remnant mass in the detector frame,
$m_\mathrm{max,det} = m_\mathrm{max,source} \left(1 + z\left( d_L \right)
\right)$, that the combined uncertainty is $1/\sqrt{N}$ smaller than the
single-measurement uncertainty, and that most detections are near threshold,
then we are dominated by the $\sim 50\%$ distance uncertainty and can achieve an
absolute distance-redshift measurement (i.e.\ constrain the local expansion
rate, $H(z)$, for $z \simeq 0.75$) at the $50 \% / \sqrt{1000/2} \simeq 2.2 \%$
level after one year, and the $1 \%$ level after five years of \ac{BBH} merger
observations at design sensitivity.

Detailed calculations support this back-of-the-envelope estimate.  We have
simulated five years of \ac{GW} observations with Advanced LIGO and Advanced
Virgo at design sensitivity.  We use a local merger rate, mass distribution, and
rate evolution with redshift that are consistent with current observations
\citep{Fishbach2017,Fishbach2018,O1O2Population}.  Our mass distribution
includes a sharp cutoff at $m = \MSourceMax{}$ to model the effects of the
\ac{PISN} process \citep{Belczynski2016}.  We use a realistic model of the
detectability of sources from this population
\citep{GW150914Rate,GW150914RateSupplement} and for mass and distance estimation
uncertainties \citep{Vitale2017}.  The properties of the simulated population
are described more fully in \S \ref{sec:simulated-population}.
