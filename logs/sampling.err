There were 333 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.8786161912402328, but should be close to 0.95. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
