Sequential sampling (4 chains in 1 job)
NUTS: [theta, dl, eta, mcdet]
There were 620 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.7735951733308527, but should be close to 0.95. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The gelman-rubin statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.

The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.7823015147491145, but should be close to 0.95. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The gelman-rubin statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
