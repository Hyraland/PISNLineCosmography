DIAGNOSTIC(S) FROM PARSER:
Warning: integer division implicitly rounds to integer. Found int division: (h - l) / 2
 Positive values rounded down, negative values rounded up or down in platform-dependent way.
Warning (non-fatal):
Left-hand side of sampling statement (~) may contain a non-linear transform of a parameter or local variable.
If it does, you need to include a target += statement with the log absolute determinant of the Jacobian of the transform.
Left-hand-side of sampling statement:
    sigma_min ~ lognormal(...)
Warning (non-fatal):
Left-hand side of sampling statement (~) may contain a non-linear transform of a parameter or local variable.
If it does, you need to include a target += statement with the log absolute determinant of the Jacobian of the transform.
Left-hand-side of sampling statement:
    sigma_max ~ lognormal(...)
Warning: left-hand side variable (name=r) occurs on right-hand side of assignment, causing inefficient deep copy to avoid aliasing.
