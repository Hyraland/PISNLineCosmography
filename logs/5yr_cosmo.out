DIAGNOSTIC(S) FROM PARSER:
Warning: integer division implicitly rounds to integer. Found int division: (h - l) / 2
 Positive values rounded down, negative values rounded up or down in platform-dependent way.
Warning (non-fatal):
Left-hand side of sampling statement (~) may contain a non-linear transform of a parameter or local variable.
If it does, you need to include a target += statement with the log absolute determinant of the Jacobian of the transform.
Left-hand-side of sampling statement:
    sigma_min ~ lognormal(...)
Warning (non-fatal):
Left-hand side of sampling statement (~) may contain a non-linear transform of a parameter or local variable.
If it does, you need to include a target += statement with the log absolute determinant of the Jacobian of the transform.
Left-hand-side of sampling statement:
    sigma_max ~ lognormal(...)
Warning: left-hand side variable (name=r) occurs on right-hand side of assignment, causing inefficient deep copy to avoid aliasing.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: need more samples for selection integral  (in 'model.stan' at line 240)

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
