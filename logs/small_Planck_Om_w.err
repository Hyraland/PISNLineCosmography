DIAGNOSTIC(S) FROM PARSER:
Warning: integer division implicitly rounds to integer. Found int division: (j - i) / 2
 Positive values rounded down, negative values rounded up or down in platform-dependent way.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: multi_normal_cholesky_lpdf: Location parameter[1] is -nan, but must be finite!  (in 'unknown file name' at line 290)

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
